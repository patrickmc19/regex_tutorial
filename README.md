# Regex Tutorial

## Challenge Description
Developers write code, but they also write about code. Take a moment to search the web for tutorials about any of the subjects you’ve learned so far in this course. You’re likely to find thousands of tutorials written by developers of all skill levels, but especially by junior developers—like you!

Your Challenge this week is to create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. You'll use the template provided in the starter code to create your tutorial.

## User Story
```
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile
```

## What Is a Regex?
A regex, which is short for regular expression, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input.

## What was my motivation?

To learn about regex and how to use them.

## Why did I build this project?

Because regex is a useful tool for developers.

## What problem does it solve?

This project helps developers understand regex and how to use them - specifically email validation. This project also helps developers understand how to write a tutorial.

## What did you learn?

I learned how to write a tutorial and how to use regex.

## What makes your project stand out?

I think this project stands out because I defined regex components that were not used in the example code. My hope is this will be used to fully comprehend regex.
